===================
 The Koala Project
===================

What is koala?
  In short, its a nice little scripting language (and accompanying IDE) to
provide a stepping stone for beginners and non-programmers. It addresses a
number of issues encountered by newcomers in hopes that those newcomers won't
be scared away by the big world of computers.

How do I try it out?
  Koala is in very early stages of development, so there isn't much to look at
yet. If you'd like to try a live demo without much hassle, visit
[ http://kueblc.myrpi.org/koala ].

Who makes koala?
  Currently, koala is being developed solely by Colin Kuebler of the Rensselaer
Center for Open Source Software (RCOS). If you'd like to help me out, send me
an email at kueblc[at]rpi[dot]edu and I'll be happy to coordinate some code.
Koala is released under GPLv3 so rest assured koala will always be open source.

Where am I?
