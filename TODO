Things to do... oh so many
* Better TODO, README, overall documentation

Brainstorm zone *you have been warned*

Philosophies:
	Server independence: should essentially be able to save the koala site and still use it

Language:
	Keywords:
		"in" - gets return value of last command
		"of" - dereference operator
		"?" - evaluates to boolean
	Debug mode: "say", "ask" map to console,
		otherwise uses alert(), prompt()
	Units as part of number literals
		ex. 3 inches -> { value: 3, type: 'number', unit: 'inches' }
		can do conversions between units with:
			measurement: distance, time, temperature, etc
			ratio relative to a fixed unit: ie, mm=.001, cm=.01, m=1
		ex. units = {
				distance: {
					mm: .001,
					cm: .01,
					m: 1, ....

File browser:
	Need icons (PD, GPLv3...)
		Default icons
		Custom (uploaded) icons
	Drag and drop support
		Drag files in to upload
		Drag files out to download
	Multiple views:
		List, icon
		Changeable by CSS class?
	Backup to localStorage
		Save to server when available
		Maintain whether it has been uploaded or not
