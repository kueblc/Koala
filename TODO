Things to do... oh so many
* Better TODO, README, overall documentation

Brainstorm zone *you have been warned*

"in" as a keyword, gets return value from command
console, "say" and "ask" "?", otherwise use alert() etc
library stored on personal computer, localStorage?
sync'd with server for sharing
should be essentially be able to save the koala site and still use it
units as part of number objects
ex.
	3 inches ->
		{ value: 3, type: 'number', unit: 'inches' }
way to convert between units
need to know 2 things about units:
	measurement: distance, time, temperature, etc
	ratio relative to a fixed unit: ie, mm=.001, cm=.01, m=1
	
units = {
	distance: {
		mm: .001,
		cm: .01,
		m: 1, ....
