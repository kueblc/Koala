#The Koala Project
###### latest development version 0.04 alpha

##What is koala?
  In short, its a nice little scripting language (and accompanying IDE) to
provide a stepping stone for beginners and non-programmers. It addresses a
number of issues encountered by newcomers in hopes that those newcomers won't
be scared away by the big world of computers.

##How do I try it out?
  Koala is in very early stages of development, so there isn't much to look at
yet. If you'd like to try a live demo without much hassle, visit
